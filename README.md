Mapping Solar Flares

You can use these codes to plot all the solar flares observed by the Solar Dynamics Observatory, which takes more data than any other NASA satellite in history, in a standard stereographic projection using D3.js. The Solar Dynamics Observatory takes about a terabyte and a half of data a day and has been running since April 2010. 

[Check out the visualization.](http://stanford.edu/~mbobra/)

To create the data visualization framework in d3, use `flares.html`.
To create the .csv files read by flares.html, use `get_the_flare_data.py`, in this same directory.
